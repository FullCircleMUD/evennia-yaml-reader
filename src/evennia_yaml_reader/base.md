# base — Reader contract

Documentation for [base.py](base.py). The source file is intentionally code-only; everything explanatory lives here.

This module defines the **contract** every source reader satisfies: a configured connection to some content backend (GitHub, local filesystem, future sources) that fetches a single YAML document at a given path and returns its raw bytes plus the parsed structure. The base classes carry no behaviour beyond the contract — concrete readers ([github.py](github.py), [local.py](local.py)) implement the actual I/O.

---

## `ReaderResult`

### Signature

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ReaderResult:
    raw_bytes: bytes
    parsed: object
```

### Purpose

The return value of every successful `Reader.read()` call. Carries both the unparsed bytes and the parsed YAML structure so callers can choose whichever they need without re-fetching:

- **`raw_bytes`** — the fetch result before any decoding. Used for hashing, logging, change-detection, or "show me exactly what the server sent" debugging surfaces. Bytes (not str) so non-UTF-8 content surfaces as a parse error rather than a silent decode artefact.
- **`parsed`** — `yaml.safe_load` output: a dict, list, scalar, or `None` (empty document). Typed as `object` because the contract doesn't constrain YAML's outer shape — that's the consumer's job.

### Design notes

- **Frozen.** A reader's result is an observation of a moment in time at the source; mutating it after return would conflate "what we read" with "what we did with it." Downstream code that needs to transform the parsed structure copies it.
- **No path / no source identifier on the result.** The caller already knows what they asked for; cluttering the result with that information makes it harder to compare results across readers or sources.
- **No error variant.** `read()` returns `ReaderResult` on success and raises a typed exception on failure (see `Reader.read` below). Forcing every caller to handle a result-or-error union for the unhappy path adds noise; raising lets each caller decide how much to catch.

### Tests

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `GitHubReaderTest.test_happy_path_returns_raw_and_parsed` | `ReaderResult` shape via the GitHub reader |
| `LocalReaderTest.test_happy_path_returns_raw_and_parsed` | `ReaderResult` shape via the local reader |

The dataclass itself is not tested in isolation — its behaviour is observable only via the readers that produce it, so subclass tests cover it.

## `Reader`

### Signature

```python
class Reader:
    required_kwargs: tuple[str, ...] = ()
    def read(self, path: str) -> ReaderResult: ...
```

### Purpose

The abstract base every concrete reader inherits. A `Reader` is a **configured connection**: construction kwargs identify the source (a repo + ref + PAT for GitHub; a directory `root` for local), and `read(path)` is the per-request query against that source.

The split between construction kwargs and per-read `path` is the load-bearing decision. It means:

- A consumer constructs **one** reader per source and reuses it across many reads.
- A consuming library can swap reader implementations at its own dispatch layer without re-reading every consumer's settings.
- `path` always means "what to fetch within the source," never "what source to fetch from" — there's no ambiguity at the call site.

The base class itself is purely a contract. Direct instantiation is meaningless; `read()` raises `NotImplementedError`. Concrete subclasses do the actual I/O and convert backend-specific errors to the typed exception hierarchy.

### Algorithm

None at the base level — the contract is what subclasses must satisfy. Each concrete reader's `read()` does:

1. Build a backend-specific request from `path` and the construction kwargs.
2. Fetch the bytes, translating backend errors to the typed exceptions below.
3. `yaml.safe_load` the bytes (translating parse errors to `ReaderParseError`).
4. Return `ReaderResult(raw_bytes, parsed)`.

See [github.py](github.py) and [local.py](local.py) for the two implementations the library ships.

### Class attribute: `required_kwargs`

A tuple of construction-kwarg names the subclass accepts. Subclasses override the empty default with their own tuple, e.g.:

```python
class GitHubReader(Reader):
    required_kwargs = ("repo", "ref", "pat")
```

Two reasons this exists:

- **Discoverability.** A consuming library (or the tooling around its settings) can introspect `MyReader.required_kwargs` to know what settings need to be supplied, without parsing a docstring.
- **Future validation.** A dispatch layer in the consuming library can check that the configured kwargs cover the chosen reader's required set before construction, surfacing missing settings before any I/O.

`path` is deliberately **not** a construction kwarg — it's supplied per-read as the query, so listing it in `required_kwargs` would be a category error.

### Method: `read(path: str) -> ReaderResult`

The single operation every reader implements. Fetch one YAML document at `path`, return a `ReaderResult` on success, raise on failure.

### Errors

`read()` must raise one of the typed exceptions from [`evennia_yaml_reader.errors`](errors.py) so callers can handle each class semantically:

| Exception | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ReaderAuthError` | Authentication / authorisation failure (HTTP 401, filesystem permission denied, …). |
| `ReaderNotFoundError` | The path didn't resolve at the source (HTTP 404, file not found, path traversal outside `root`). |
| `ReaderNetworkError` | Generic network / OS-level read failure that isn't auth or not-found. |
| `ReaderParseError` | Bytes fetched OK but the parse step failed (invalid YAML, non-UTF-8, …). |
| `ReaderError` | Base class — used for anything reader-specific that doesn't fit the above. |

Concrete readers must NOT leak backend-specific exception types to callers; translation to the typed hierarchy is part of the contract.

### Design notes

- **No `close()` / context manager.** Readers don't hold resources between calls — every `read()` is independent. If a future reader needs connection pooling, that's the subclass's concern; the contract stays single-call-per-fetch.
- **No retry / caching.** Each is a strictly orthogonal concern that belongs in a wrapper or middleware, not the contract. A reader that retries internally couples policy with mechanism in a way that's hard to override.
- **`path` is `str`, not `Path`.** The contract is platform-neutral and works against backends where filesystem paths aren't meaningful (HTTP, S3 keys). A backend that wants `pathlib.Path` semantics converts at its own boundary.

### Tests

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `GitHubReaderTest.test_required_kwargs_declared` | `required_kwargs` override contract via the GitHub reader |
| `LocalReaderTest.test_required_kwargs_declared` | `required_kwargs` override contract via the local reader |
| All `GitHubReaderTest` and `LocalReaderTest` cases | The `read(path) -> ReaderResult` contract end-to-end (happy path + every typed-exception path) |

The base class has no direct tests because it carries no behaviour. The contract is exercised only through subclasses, which is correct — testing `Reader.read()`'s `NotImplementedError` branch would be a tautology.
