"""LocalReader — reads YAML files from a local directory tree.

Counterpart to GitHubReader for the case where the YAML repo is checked
out on disk: local development, CI validation, or any consumer that
prefers to fetch content from the filesystem rather than over HTTP.

Construction kwargs:
    root: filesystem path to the directory the consumer treats as the
          source root. The path supplied per-read is interpreted relative
          to this directory.

Reads that resolve outside ``root`` are rejected with ReaderNotFoundError —
path-traversal guard, not a feature.
